# tinyShell
a simple shell written in C

This is a simple shell written in C for cs351. To use, clone the repository then run 'make' to compile. TO start the shell, run './tsh'

Once inside the shell, run -h to get help to learn more about the commands.

Note: in the current state of the shell, the path is not as advanced as a standard shell, so in order to call scripts or build in commands, you need to use the full path in the command.

For example, in order to use ls you need to call:

/bin/ls
